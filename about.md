### Weird third-person description

Stuti is a caffeine-powered music-addict living in Singapore. She listens to music like itâ€™s her full-time job. (Somebody really ought to start paying her for it) But apart from that, her main interest lies in technology. She's a data analyst at an awesome global TV site called [viki.com](http://www.viki.com). Apart from her love for numbers, she also enjoyes learning about design/UI/UX related things. 

Oh, and she loves dogs. 

..and she's a tree-hugging vegetarian. (Ok, i'm finally done)
