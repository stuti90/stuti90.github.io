I set up my github pages blog back in March and then didn't touch it after. Terrible, I know. But here's attempt #2! The aim is to write one blog post a week about something new I learnt at work. I'll probably write my first post this weekend, but meanwhile, I did a quick touchup on how the blog looks. (I prefer this so much more to the old Hyde theme!)
